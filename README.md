The Loan_train.csv and Loan_test.csv files are created directly by downloading from the links mentioned. The links to the datasets can be found in cells of notebook.
  
Perfromed Data Cleaning, Feature Selection/Extraction, Converting Categorical to Numerical values, One Hot encoding, Normailzed data, Train-Test-Split the data and   
Build different classifier models to predict whether a loan case is paid off or not from features like education, due_date, effective_date etc., and calculated accuracy of the built model using different evaluation metrics.    
  

Classifier Models Built are:
1) k-Nearest Neighbour.
2) Decision Tree.
3) Support Vector Machine.
4) Logistic Regression.

Evaluation Metrics used are:
1) Jaccard Index.
2) F1-score.
3) Logloss.
