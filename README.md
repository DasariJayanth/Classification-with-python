**Dataset:** Loan_train.csv and Loan_test.csv files are directly downloaded from the links mentioned in the cells of notebook.
     
      
## Workflow:  
1. Data Cleaning.  
2. Feature Extraction and Feature Selection.  
3. Converting Categorical to Numerical Values.  
4. One Hot Encoding.  
5. Normalization.  
6. Train-Test Split.  
7. Model Prediction(Loan Case is paid off or not).  
8. Results(Evaluation Metrics).  

Classifier Models Built are:
1. k-Nearest Neighbour.
2. Decision Tree.
3. Support Vector Machine.
4. Logistic Regression.

Evaluation Metrics used are:
1. Jaccard Index.
2. F1-score.
3. Logloss.
