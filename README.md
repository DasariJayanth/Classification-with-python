# Classification-with-python
In this project, I built different classifier models to predict whether a loan case is paid off or not and calculated accuracy of the built model using different evaluation metrics. The Loan_train.csv and Loan_test.csv files are created directly by downloading from the links mentioned in cells of notebook.

Classifier Models Built are:
1) k-Nearest Neighbour.
2) Decision Tree.
3) Support Vector Machine.
4) Logistic Regression.

Evaluation Metrics used are:
1) Jaccard Index.
2) F1-score.
3) Logloss.
